      <h1 class="pt-2">About me and my life.</h1>
      <p class="py-2">Probably no one knows such a glorious city of Lida in which I was born and grew up. it is located
        in the western part of Belarus near the border with Lithuania. I also went to school there, where I got
        acquainted with programming for the first time. My first program was a script written in pseudocode based on C++ in the
        GameMaker game engine. It was back in 2003.</p>
      <p class="py-2">I also really like teaching people, no matter who, my son or an adult who needs to learn a new
        framework, I know how to find an approach to everyone</p>
      <p class="py-2">Then there was the university and the beginning of my career. for the most part, I was engaged in
        freelancing and, starting in 2019, I went into commercial projects.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">In my free time, I like to travel by my own car with my family, I also love my home, but
        unfortunately, I have been there very rarely lately. I like to decorate it with all sorts of homemade interior
        items. My wife and I love making them with our own hands. I have two dogs that are like my children to me.</p>
